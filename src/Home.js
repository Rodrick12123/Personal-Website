                  <p>Hello World, my name is Rodrick Victdeon Lankford. I am a skilled
                  programmer who enjoys the challenge of solving challenging problems. I graduated from 
                  Carleton College in June 2023 with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. 
                  My peers know me as reliable and someone who completes assigned 
                  duties promptly. One of my biggest career motivators 
                  involves the implementation of innovative and creative software that push 
                  the capabilities of technology to a new level. That said, I desire to 
                  continue applying my skills to improve the 
                  quality of life for all.</p>
                </p>
                <p>Fun fact my favorite color is gold.</p>
